# 🌡️ Temperature Monitoring and Analysis System

A simple C++ console-based application that manages daily temperature records over a 30-day month. It allows you to:

- Add/display daytime and nighttime temperatures
- Calculate temperature fluctuations
- Analyze suitability for orchid growth
- Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit

---

## 📌 Features

- Input and display daily **day/night temperatures**
- Calculate:
  - **Daily fluctuations**
  - **Max, Min, and Average** day/night temperatures
- Analyze **suitability for orchid growth** (based on ideal temperature ranges)
- **Convert temperatures** from Centigrade to Fahrenheit

---

## 🧪 Orchid Suitability Criteria

A day is suitable for orchid growth if:

- Daytime Temperature: **70°F - 80°F**
- Nighttime Temperature: **56°F - 62°F**
- Temperature Fluctuation: **10°F - 15°F**
